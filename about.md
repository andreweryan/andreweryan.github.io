Welcome! This is my personal site (and future blog) which is currently under construction.


I'm a data scientist and software engineer with 10+ years in geospatial tech. My current focus is on developing data science, machine learning, and computer vision solutions for satellite imagery. I'm proficient in Python, SQL, and have some experience developing webmaps and websites in JavaScript. I'm currently learning Rust and Go to become a truly polyglot engineer.
